## Implemented Services

### API Gateway
The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling:
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Authentication and authorization via JWT
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request/response logging
- API documentation via Swagger UI

**Key Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - Routes to Authentication Service
- `/api/v1/patients/*` - Routes to Patient Service
- `/docs` - Interactive API documentation

### Authentication Service
The Authentication Service manages user identity and access:
- User registration and account management
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based access control

**Key Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Authenticate and receive JWT
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

### Patient Service
The Patient Service manages patient data and medical records:
- Patient profile creation and management
- Medical history tracking
- Allergy and medication management
- Practitioner assignment

**Key Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/patients` - List patients (for practitioners)
- `GET /api/v1/patients/{id}` - Get patient details
- `POST /api/v1/patients` - Create new patient record
- `PUT /api/v1/patients/{id}` - Update patient information
- `GET /api/v1/patients/{id}/medical-records` - Get patient medical records

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Docker deployment)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- PostgreSQL (for local development)
- Redis (for local development)

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TeleHealth.git
cd TeleHealth
```

2. Create `.env` files for each service
```bash
# For the API Gateway
cp gateway/.env.example gateway/.env
# For the Auth Service
cp auth-service/.env.example auth-service/.env
# For the Patient Service
cp patient-service/.env.example patient-service/.env
# Edit the .env files with your configuration
```

3. Start the application using Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.modified.yml up -d
```

4. Access the application
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Auth Service: http://localhost:8001
- Patient Service: http://localhost:8002

## Development

We've added comprehensive development guides to help you get started:

- **[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)**: Detailed instructions for setting up your development environment
- **[HOW_TO_RUN.md](./HOW_TO_RUN.md)**: Step-by-step guide for running the application
- **[DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**: Solutions for common Docker issues

### Option 1: Docker-based Setup

- **Windows**: Run `.\run-app.ps1` in PowerShell
- **macOS/Linux**: Run `./run-app.sh` in Terminal (you may need to make it executable first with `chmod +x run-app.sh`)

These scripts will:
1. Check if Docker is running
2. Create necessary environment files
3. Guide you through running the application using either Docker or local development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd teleHealth

# Run the interactive script
.\run-app.ps1  # Windows
./run-app.sh   # macOS/Linux

# Or manually:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.modified.yml up -d
```

### Option 2: Local Development

If you're experiencing Docker issues, use our local development scripts:

- **Windows**: Run `.\run-local.ps1` in PowerShell
- **macOS/Linux**: Run `./run-local.sh` in Terminal (you may need to make it executable first with `chmod +x run-local.sh`)

These scripts will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Check if PostgreSQL and Redis are installed
4. Guide you through running each service

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd teleHealth

# Run the local development script
.\run-local.ps1  # Windows
./run-local.sh   # macOS/Linux
```

For detailed instructions, see [HOW_TO_RUN.md](./HOW_TO_RUN.md).
